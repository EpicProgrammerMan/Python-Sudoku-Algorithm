# Python-Sudoku-Algorithm
A short python program that can output the solution of a given solvable sudoku puzzle


Using a series of logical algorithms and a bit of brute force, this program is able to solve just about any solvable sudoku puzzle.
When using the program, you can either:
1. Input your own custom sudoku puzzle as a 81-digit string.
2. Tell the program to solve a certain range of puzzles from the attached "puzzles" file.
3. Tell the program to read from the puzzles file and write the solutions to the "solutions" text file. This file is already full; this is what I used to fill it out. If one were to erase any number of lines from the end of the solutions file, they could use this function to fill the rest of it out.

When you command the program to solve a sudoku, you may choose either to see just the resulting solution, or to see the full incremental process of solving the sudoku.
